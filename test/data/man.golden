ARCHITECTURES
    hix supports the following architecture patterns:

    Onion Architecture
        - Domain: Business logic and models
        - Application: Services and use cases
        - Infrastructure: Technical implementations
        - Presentation: UI and controllers

    Clean Architecture
        - Entities: Business entities and value objects
        - UseCases: Application use cases and rules
        - InterfaceAdapters: Controllers and presenters
        - FrameworksAndDrivers: External interfaces

    Hexagonal Architecture
        - Domain: Business logic and models
        - Application: Services and ports
        - Adapters: External system adapters
        - Infrastructure: Technical implementations

    Custom Architecture
        You can also define your own architecture with custom layers.

TEMPLATES
    Templates are used to generate code for each layer. They support the following
    features:

    - Model properties: [[prop]] ... [[/prop]]
    - Model values: [[model.className]]
    - Property values: [[prop.name]], [[prop.type]]

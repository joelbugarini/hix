# Version 0.3.0.2

## Highlights

- **Renderer Refactor:**
  - Split renderer into `RenderNode` and `RenderProp` modules for better maintainability.
  - Modularized AST and rendering logic.
  - Adopted a layered source structure for improved code organization.

- **Template Engine Improvements:**
  - All code generation now uses the full template engine (no legacy string replacement).
  - Property and model tokens are handled robustly during property iteration.
  - All template tokens are always transformed or removed; unhandled tokens are suppressed and a warning is shown.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error handling for missing templates and arguments.
  - User-friendly error messages for missing files, arguments, or invalid combinations.

- **Testing and Output:**
  - Tests fixed to expect correct token cleanup (no untransformed tokens remain in output).
  - Debug output removed from production and test output for clean logs.

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to config or template syntax.
- All template tokens must now be valid or will be removed from output.
- Error messages are now more consistent and user-friendly.

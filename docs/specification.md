# Hix Specification

This document outlines the specification and feature selection process for Hix.

## Feature Selection Process

Features in Hix are selected based on the following criteria:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Must align with Hix's primary goal of code generation
   - Should solve a common code generation problem
   - Must maintain backward compatibility

2. **Implementation Priority**
   - High: Critical for basic functionality
   - Medium: Enhances existing features
   - Low: Nice-to-have features

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Must be implementable within the current architecture
   - Should not compromise performance
   - Must be testable

## Architecture Specification

### Parser
- Handles template syntax parsing
- Supports nested expressions
- Maintains context for variable substitution
- Validates template syntax

### Model Processor
- Validates JSON model structure
- Processes model transformations
- Handles type conversions
- Supports model inheritance

### Template Engine
- Renders templates with model data
- Supports conditional logic
- Handles loops and iterations
- Manages output formatting

## Feature Implementation Process

1. **Proposal**
   - Feature is proposed in GitHub Issues
   - Community discussion and feedback
   - Technical review by maintainers

2. **Specification**
   - Detailed technical specification
   - API design
   - Backward compatibility analysis
   - Performance impact assessment

3. **Implementation**
   - Development in feature branch
   - Unit tests
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Review**
   - Code review
   - Documentation review
   - Performance review
   - Security review

5. **Release**
   - Version bump
   - Release notes
   - Documentation updates
   - Community announcement

## Versioning

Hix follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Backward Compatibility

- Breaking changes require MAJOR version bump
- Deprecated features are marked in documentation
- Migration guides provided for breaking changes
- Support for older versions maintained for 6 months

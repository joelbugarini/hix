# Hix - A Code Generation Tool for Clean Architecture

Hix is a powerful code generation tool designed to help you implement clean architecture patterns in your projects. It uses templates and models to generate consistent, well-structured code across different layers of your application.

## Features

- **Template-based Code Generation**: Write templates once, generate code for multiple models
- **Clean Architecture Support**: Built-in support for Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
- **Flexible Template Language**: Simple yet powerful template syntax with conditionals and loops
- **Model-driven Development**: Define your models in JSON and generate code automatically
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface with initialization and help features
- **Customizable Architecture**: Support for different architecture patterns (Clean, Onion, Hexagonal)
- **Extensible**: Add your own templates and customize the generation process

## Quick Start

1. **Install Hix**:
   ```bash
   stack install hix
   ```

2. **Initialize a Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   hix init
   ```

3. **Create a Model**:
   ```json
   {
     "className": "User",
     "properties": [
       { "name": "Id", "type": "int" },
       { "name": "Name", "type": "string" }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Generate Code**:
   ```bash
   hix User.json
   ```
